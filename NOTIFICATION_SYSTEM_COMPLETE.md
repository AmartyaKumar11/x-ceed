# 🎉 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM COMPLETE - FINAL VERIFICATION

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY

**ORIGINAL PROBLEM:** Interview scheduling notifications weren't appearing in applicant notification panels, and we needed to verify accept/reject status notifications work correctly.

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Data type mismatch between notification storage (userId as string) and query (userId as ObjectId).

## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Interview Scheduling Notifications ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `/src/pages/api/applications/schedule-interview.js`
- **Fix:** Changed `userId: applicant._id.toString()` to `userId: applicant._id`
- **Result:** Notifications now store ObjectId format consistently

### 2. Interview Invitation Notifications ✅ FIXED  
- **File:** `/src/pages/api/applications/send-interview-invite.js`
- **Fix:** Updated userId format to use ObjectId instead of string
- **Result:** Interview invitations create proper notifications

### 3. Notification List API ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `/src/pages/api/notifications/index.js`  
- **Fix:** Updated database connection and added missing imports
- **Result:** API endpoints work correctly

### 4. Accept/Reject Status Notifications ✅ VERIFIED
- **File:** `/src/pages/api/applications/[id].js`
- **Status:** Already working correctly
- **Result:** Automatic notifications created when recruiters update application status
