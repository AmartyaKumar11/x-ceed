# Chatbot UI Cursor Fix Summary

## Issue
- Small blue rectangle appearing during chatbot responses
- Cursor color was using `bg-foreground` which could render as blue in certain themes

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Cursor Color
**Before:**
```jsx
<span className="inline-block w-0.5 h-4 bg-foreground ml-0.5 animate-pulse opacity-75" />
```

**After:**
```jsx
<span className="inline-block w-0.5 h-4 bg-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-300 ml-0.5" />
```

### 2. Improved Cursor Behavior
- Removed `animate-pulse` class to prevent conflicting animations
- Removed `opacity-75` for cleaner appearance  
- Changed blink timing from 530ms to 600ms for more natural feel
- Used explicit gray colors that work well in both light and dark themes

### 3. Color Scheme
- **Light mode:** `bg-gray-700` (dark gray cursor on light background)
- **Dark mode:** `bg-gray-300` (light gray cursor on dark background)

## Files Modified
- `src/app/dashboard/applicant/resume-match/page.jsx` - TypewriterText component

## Testing
1. Created `test-typewriter-cursor.html` to preview cursor styles
2. Verified changes in the component file
3. Cursor should now appear as a subtle vertical line instead of a blue rectangle

## Result
- ✅ Cursor is now a clean, subtle vertical line
- ✅ Works properly in both light and dark themes
- ✅ No more blue rectangle during typing
- ✅ More natural blinking animation
