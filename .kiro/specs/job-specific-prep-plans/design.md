# Design Document

## Overview

The job-specific prep plan generation system needs to be redesigned to ensure that users receive targeted, relevant learning recommendations based on their specific job applications. The current system is falling back to generic topics due to AI API failures and insufficient job description analysis. This design addresses these issues through improved prompt engineering, robust fallback mechanisms, and enhanced job requirement extraction.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Job Analysis Engine**
   - Job description parser with NLP capabilities
   - Skill extraction using multiple techniques (keyword matching, pattern recognition, context analysis)
   - Company and role-specific requirement identification

2. **Improved AI Prompt System**
   - More specific and detailed prompts for AI models
   - Better context formatting with clear job-specific instructions
   - Multiple prompt strategies for different AI models

3. **Robust Fallback System**
   - Job-specific fallback plan generation when AI fails
   - Intelligent skill gap analysis using job description parsing
   - Context-aware topic prioritization

4. **Gap Analysis Enhancement**
   - Multi-source skill comparison (resume, profile, job requirements)
   - Skill level assessment and progression planning
   - Priority scoring based on job criticality

## Components and Interfaces

### JobAnalysisEngine

```javascript
class JobAnalysisEngine {
  // Extract specific skills and technologies from job description
  extractJobRequirements(jobDescription, jobTitle, requirements)
  
  // Analyze job context (seniority, domain, company type)
  analyzeJobContext(jobData)
  
  // Score skill importance based on job description frequency and context
  scoreSkillImportance(skills, jobDescription)
  
  // Extract company-specific technologies and practices
  extractCompanySpecificRequirements(jobDescription, companyName)
}
```

### EnhancedPromptBuilder

```javascript
class EnhancedPromptBuilder {
  // Build job-specific AI prompts with detailed context
  buildJobSpecificPrompt(jobData, userProfile, resumeAnalysis, duration)
  
  // Create fallback prompts for different AI models
  buildFallbackPrompts(jobData, userProfile)
  
  // Format resume analysis data for AI consumption
  formatResumeAnalysisForAI(resumeAnalysis)
  
  // Add job-specific examples and constraints to prompts
  addJobSpecificConstraints(prompt, jobData)
}
```

### RobustFallbackGenerator

```javascript
class RobustFallbackGenerator {
  // Generate job-specific plan when AI fails
  generateJobSpecificFallback(jobData, userProfile, resumeAnalysis, duration)
  
  // Perform intelligent skill gap analysis
  performSkillGapAnalysis(jobRequirements, userSkills, resumeAnalysis)
  
  // Create targeted learning topics based on job requirements
  createTargetedTopics(missingSkills, skillsToImprove, jobData)
  
  // Generate job-specific milestones and progression
  generateJobSpecificMilestones(topics, duration, jobData)
}
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Job Data Structure

```javascript
{
  jobTitle: string,
  companyName: string,
  jobDescriptionText: string,
  requirements: string[],
  extractedSkills: {
    required: string[],
    preferred: string[],
    technologies: string[],
    frameworks: string[],
    tools: string[],
    concepts: string[]
  },
  jobContext: {
    seniorityLevel: string,
    domain: string,
    companyType: string,
    teamSize: string,
    workStyle: string
  },
  skillImportanceScores: {
    [skill: string]: number
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Gap Analysis Result

```javascript
{
  criticalMissingSkills: [
    {
      skill: string,
      importance: number,
      foundInJob: string[], // Where in job description
      learningPriority: 'critical' | 'important' | 'nice-to-have'
    }
  ],
  skillsToAdvance: [
    {
      skill: string,
      currentLevel: string,
      targetLevel: string,
      gapDescription: string,
      jobRequirement: string
    }
  ],
  matchingStrengths: [
    {
      skill: string,
      confidence: number,
      jobRelevance: string
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

### AI API Failure Handling

1. **Primary AI Model Failure**
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Try alternative AI models in order of preference
   - Log specific failure reasons for debugging

2. **All AI Models Failure**
   - Activate robust fallback system
   - Generate job-specific plan using rule-based approach
   - Ensure fallback quality meets minimum standards

3. **Invalid AI Response Handling**
   - Multiple JSON parsing strategies
   - Response validation and correction
   - Fallback to structured template if parsing fails

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Missing Job Description**
   - Use job title and requirements for basic analysis
   - Generate generic but relevant topics for the role
   - Prompt user for more detailed job information

2. **Missing Resume Analysis**
   - Perform basic skill comparison using user profile
   - Use conservative gap analysis approach
   - Focus on commonly required skills for the role

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Job Analysis Engine Tests**
   - Test skill extraction from various job descriptions
   - Verify company-specific requirement identification
   - Test skill importance scoring accuracy

2. **Prompt Builder Tests**
   - Test prompt generation with different data combinations
   - Verify job-specific context inclusion
   - Test fallback prompt strategies

3. **Fallback Generator Tests**
   - Test job-specific fallback plan generation
   - Verify skill gap analysis accuracy
   - Test topic relevance and prioritization

### Integration Tests

1. **End-to-End Prep Plan Generation**
   - Test with real job descriptions and user profiles
   - Verify AI integration and fallback behavior
   - Test with various duration and approach combinations

2. **Error Scenario Testing**
   - Test AI API failure scenarios
   - Test invalid data handling
   - Test partial data scenarios

### Quality Assurance

1. **Job Specificity Validation**
   - Verify generated topics match job requirements
   - Check that generic topics are minimized
   - Validate explanation quality and relevance

2. **Gap Analysis Accuracy**
   - Compare generated gaps with manual analysis
   - Verify skill level assessments
   - Test with various user experience levels
