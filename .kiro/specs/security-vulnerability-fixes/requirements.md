# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The X-CEED recruitment platform needs an intelligent AI-powered preparation plan creation system that analyzes gaps between user resumes and job descriptions to generate personalized, adaptive learning plans with dynamic content recommendations and progress tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Resume-Job Gap Analysis

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want the system to analyze the differences between my resume and target job requirements, so that I can identify specific skills and knowledge gaps I need to address.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a resume and job description are uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract and parse key skills, technologies, and requirements from both documents
2. WHEN skills are compared THEN the system SHALL identify missing skills, experience gaps, and knowledge deficiencies
3. WHEN gap analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL categorize gaps by priority (critical, important, nice-to-have)
4. WHEN technical skills are analyzed THEN the system SHALL distinguish between programming languages, frameworks, tools, and soft skills
5. WHEN experience levels are compared THEN the system SHALL identify seniority gaps and suggest appropriate learning depth
6. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback suggestions

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Preparation Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want personalized preparation plans that adapt to my chosen timeframe, so that I can efficiently prepare for interviews whether I have 1 month or 3 months available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparation plans are generated THEN they SHALL default to 3-month duration with comprehensive learning paths
2. WHEN users select 1-month duration THEN the system SHALL recommend concise, one-shot tutorial videos and crash courses
3. WHEN users select 3-month duration THEN the system SHALL recommend detailed courses, practice projects, and progressive learning paths
4. WHEN plan duration changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically recalculate content recommendations and time allocations
5. WHEN learning objectives are set THEN they SHALL be mapped to specific, measurable outcomes
6. WHEN plans are created THEN they SHALL include weekly milestones and progress checkpoints

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Content Recommendation System

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want contextually relevant YouTube videos and learning resources recommended based on my specific skill gaps, so that I can focus on the most impactful learning materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube videos are recommended THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant to identified skill gaps
2. WHEN playlists are created THEN they SHALL be organized by learning objectives and time constraints
3. WHEN content is suggested THEN it SHALL prioritize high-quality, recent, and well-rated educational content
4. WHEN multiple learning styles are considered THEN the system SHALL include videos, tutorials, documentation, and practice exercises
5. WHEN content recommendations are made THEN they SHALL include estimated time commitments
6. WHEN alternative resources are needed THEN the system SHALL provide backup content options

### Requirement 4: Learning Progress Tracking and Validation

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want the system to accurately track my learning progress and adapt recommendations based on my actual engagement, so that my preparation plan stays relevant and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users watch videos THEN the system SHALL track viewing progress with timestamps and engagement metrics
2. WHEN video viewing reaches 75% completion THEN the system SHALL mark it as "watched" and update progress
3. WHEN users skip through videos without watching THEN the system SHALL not count it as completed
4. WHEN learning progress is tracked THEN it SHALL be stored securely and associated with the user's preparation plan
5. WHEN progress milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL update plan recommendations accordingly
6. WHEN users consistently skip content THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative learning materials or adjust difficulty
7. WHEN viewing patterns indicate disengagement THEN the system SHALL recommend plan adjustments or different content types

### Requirement 5: AI Service Integration and Reliability

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want AI services to work reliably with proper error handling and fallback options, so that preparation plan generation doesn't fail unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper timeout and retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN AI responses are received THEN they SHALL be validated for expected structure and content quality
3. WHEN AI services are down THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with cached or template-based recommendations
4. WHEN AI API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors and provide meaningful user feedback
5. WHEN AI response parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content and log errors for debugging
6. WHEN multiple AI services are available THEN the system SHALL implement proper failover logic between providers
