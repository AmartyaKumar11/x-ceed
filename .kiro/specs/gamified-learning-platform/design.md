# Design Document

## Overview

The Gamified Learning Platform transforms traditional online education into an engaging, high-stakes experience where users bet on their own success. By combining AI-powered personalization, blockchain smart contracts, and sophisticated anti-gaming measures, the platform creates a unique ecosystem that maximizes learning commitment and outcomes.

## Demo Mode Implementation

**IMPORTANT: For hackathon and development phases, this system operates in DEMO MODE with:**

- **Virtual Currency Only**: All betting uses simulated tokens/coins with no real monetary value
- **Mock Blockchain**: Smart contracts are simulated without actual blockchain transactions
- **Demo Wallets**: Users interact with fake wallet interfaces for demonstration purposes
- **Simulated Payouts**: All rewards and penalties are virtual for testing and demonstration
- **No Real Money**: Zero financial risk during development and testing phases
- **Full Functionality Demo**: All features work exactly as they would with real money, but safely simulated

This allows complete testing and demonstration of the innovative gamification mechanics without any financial risk during development.

- Integrates with resume analysis for precise skill gap identification

**Plan Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  jobTargetId: string,
  timeline: number, // weeks
  difficultyScore: number, // 1-10
  skillGaps: SkillGap[],
  learningPath: LearningModule[],
  milestones: Milestone[],
  payoutMultiplier: number,
  customizations: UserCustomization[],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 2. Simulated Blockchain Betting System (Demo Mode)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate learning bet management through simulated smart contracts without real transactions

**Mock Smart Contract Functions:**

- `applyRiskFactors(multiplier, userHistory, contentType)` - Risk-based modifications
- `validatePayoutSustainability(proposedPayout, platformReserves)` - Ensure platform viability

**Payout Calculation Formula:**
```
Payout Multiplier = Base Multiplier × Timeline Compression Factor × Difficulty Bonus × User Risk Factor × Market Adjustment

Where:
- Base Multiplier: 1.1 - 1.5 (platform standard)
- Timeline Compression: 1.0 - 3.0 (based on aggressive timeline choice)
- Difficulty Bonus: 1.0 - 2.0 (based on content complexity)
- User Risk Factor: 0.8 - 1.2 (based on historical performance)
- Market Adjustment: 0.9 - 1.1 (based on platform economics)
```
