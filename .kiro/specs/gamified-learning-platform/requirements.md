# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The X-CEED platform will feature a revolutionary gamified learning system where users can bet on their own learning success. The system combines AI-powered personalized learning plans with blockchain-based smart contracts, allowing users to stake money on completing courses within self-chosen timeframes. Successful completion returns their stake plus incentives, with higher payouts for more challenging timelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Personalized Learning Plan Creation

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want AI to create a personalized learning plan based on my skill gaps and chosen timeline, so that I can efficiently prepare for my target role with content tailored to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a prep plan THEN the system SHALL analyze their resume vs job requirements to identify specific skill gaps
2. WHEN skill gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL generate personalized learning content recommendations based on the user's current skill level
3. WHEN users select a timeline THEN the system SHALL adapt content difficulty and volume accordingly (intensive for shorter timelines, comprehensive for longer ones)
4. WHEN learning plans are created THEN they SHALL include curated YouTube videos, courses, and practice projects specific to identified gaps
5. WHEN content is recommended THEN it SHALL be ranked by quality, relevance, and user reviews
6. WHEN plans are generated THEN they SHALL include weekly milestones and measurable learning objectives

### Requirement 2: Virtual Betting and Gamification System (Demo Mode)

**User Story:** As a motivated learner, I want to simulate betting virtual currency on my ability to complete a learning plan within a chosen timeframe, so that I can experience the gamification mechanics without financial risk during the development phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create a learning plan THEN they SHALL be able to stake virtual currency (demo tokens) on their completion within the chosen timeline
2. WHEN users choose shorter completion times THEN the system SHALL offer higher payout multipliers to reflect increased difficulty (simulated)

4. WHEN users fail to complete within the timeline THEN their virtual stake SHALL be forfeited to the demo reward pool
5. WHEN payout calculations are made THEN they SHALL be based on timeline difficulty, content complexity, and historical completion rates (all simulated)
6. WHEN demo betting is enabled THEN the system SHALL simulate blockchain smart contracts for transparent and automated payouts without real transactions

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Video Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to ensure users genuinely engage with learning content rather than gaming the system, so that the betting mechanism maintains integrity and learning outcomes are authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users watch videos THEN the system SHALL track multiple engagement metrics including watch time, pause patterns, and interaction frequency
2. WHEN video completion is assessed THEN the system SHALL require minimum engagement thresholds beyond simple time-based completion
3. WHEN suspicious viewing patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential gaming attempts and require additional verification
4. WHEN users attempt to skip or fast-forward excessively THEN the system SHALL not count the content as completed
5. WHEN engagement is measured THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze viewing behavior patterns against known authentic learning behaviors
6. WHEN verification is needed THEN the system SHALL include periodic comprehension checks and practical demonstrations

### Requirement 4: User-Curated Learning Paths

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to create my own custom learning path by selecting from AI-recommended content based on reviews and ratings, so that I can optimize my learning experience while maintaining the betting system's integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI recommends content THEN users SHALL be able to view detailed reviews, ratings, and completion statistics for each item
2. WHEN users customize their learning path THEN they SHALL be able to replace AI-recommended content with equivalent alternatives
3. WHEN content substitutions are made THEN the system SHALL recalculate difficulty scores and payout multipliers accordingly
4. WHEN users create custom paths THEN the AI SHALL validate that the path adequately covers required learning objectives
5. WHEN custom paths are approved THEN they SHALL maintain the same betting and tracking requirements as AI-generated paths
6. WHEN path modifications affect difficulty THEN payout calculations SHALL be automatically updated

### Requirement 5: Simulated Blockchain Integration and Mock Smart Contracts (Demo Mode)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to experience how learning bets would be managed through blockchain smart contracts in a simulated environment, so that I can understand the system's mechanics without real financial transactions during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users place learning bets THEN virtual funds SHALL be locked in simulated smart contracts with transparent terms display
2. WHEN learning milestones are achieved THEN mock smart contracts SHALL automatically verify completion through simulated oracle data feeds
3. WHEN final completion is verified THEN mock smart contracts SHALL automatically execute virtual payouts without real transactions
4. WHEN disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide transparent audit trails and simulated arbitration mechanisms
5. WHEN mock smart contracts are deployed THEN they SHALL simulate security features and include demo emergency pause mechanisms
6. WHEN simulated blockchain transactions occur THEN they SHALL display how real transactions would work with multiple cryptocurrencies

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered Payout Calculation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fair and dynamic payout calculations that reflect the true difficulty of my chosen learning challenge, so that rewards are proportional to effort and risk taken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payout multipliers are calculated THEN they SHALL consider timeline compression, content difficulty, historical completion rates, and user's skill level
2. WHEN users choose aggressive timelines THEN multipliers SHALL increase exponentially to reflect higher difficulty
3. WHEN content complexity is assessed THEN the AI SHALL analyze video difficulty, prerequisite knowledge, and typical learning curves
4. WHEN historical data is used THEN the system SHALL track completion rates by user demographics and skill levels for accurate risk assessment
5. WHEN multipliers are presented THEN users SHALL see transparent breakdowns of how their payout was calculated
6. WHEN market conditions change THEN payout algorithms SHALL adapt to maintain platform sustainability

### Requirement 7: Advanced Anti-Gaming Measures

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want sophisticated systems to prevent users from cheating the learning verification process, so that the betting system maintains integrity and genuine learning is rewarded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video engagement is tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor mouse movement, tab focus, audio levels, and interaction patterns
2. WHEN completion verification is required THEN users SHALL complete randomized comprehension quizzes based on video content
3. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL require live video verification or practical demonstrations
4. WHEN multiple devices are used THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent simultaneous viewing attempts
