# ✅ RECRUITER NOTIFICATION FLOW - COMPLETE GUIDE

## 🔄 **How Recruiter Notifications Work**

Yes! When a recruiter sends a notification from the recruiter side, it **will show up in the applicant's notification panel**. Here's exactly how it works:

---

## 📋 **The Complete Flow**

### **1. Recruiter Actions That Create Notifications**

#### **🗓️ Interview Scheduling**
```javascript
// When recruiter schedules interview via:
// Recruiter Dashboard → Jobs → View Candidates → Schedule Interview

// This creates a notification like:
{
  userId: applicant._id,           // ObjectId format (FIXED!)
  type: 'interview_scheduled',
  title: '📅 Interview Scheduled',
  message: 'Your interview for Senior Developer at TechCorp has been scheduled...',
  company: 'TechCorp',
  position: 'Senior Developer',
  priority: 'urgent',
  actionRequired: true,
  interviewDate: new Date('2025-06-12'),
  timestamp: new Date()
}
```

#### **✅ Application Status Updates**
```javascript
// When recruiter updates application status (accept/reject):
// Recruiter Dashboard → Jobs → View Candidates → Update Status

// Creates notifications like:
{
  type: 'application_accepted',    // or 'application_rejected'
  title: '🎉 Application Accepted!',
  message: 'Congratulations! Your application for...',
  priority: 'high',               // 'medium' for rejections
  actionRequired: true
}
```

### **2. How Notifications Appear to Applicants**

#### **🔔 Notification Bell (Bottom-Right Corner)**
- Shows **red dot indicator** when there are unread notifications
- Displays **count of unread notifications**
- **Real-time polling** every 30 seconds for updates

#### **📋 Notification Panel (When Bell is Clicked)**
```
