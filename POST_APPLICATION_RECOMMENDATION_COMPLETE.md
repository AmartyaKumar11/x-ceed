## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### API Logic Flow:
1. Receives jobId parameter and validates authentication
2. Fetches original job details
3. Gets list of jobs user has already applied to
4. Queries for similar jobs using MongoDB aggregation:
   - Same department OR same level OR title keyword match
   - Excludes original job and previously applied jobs
   - Only active jobs with open applications
5. Returns first similar job or fallback to any available job

### Frontend Flow:
1. User submits job application successfully
2. JobApplicationDialog closes and triggers PostApplicationRecommendationDialog
3. Dialog automatically fetches similar job via API
4. Shows success message with recommended job details
5. User can click "View Details" to apply to recommended job
6. Opens new JobApplicationDialog for the recommended job

### Similarity Algorithm:
Jobs are considered similar if they match:
- **Department**: Same department (e.g., Engineering, Marketing)
- **Level**: Same experience level (e.g., Junior, Senior, Lead)
- **Title Keywords**: First two words of job title (case-insensitive regex)

### Error Handling:
- No similar jobs found â†’ Shows fallback active jobs
- No jobs available â†’ Shows appropriate message
- API errors â†’ Shows user-friendly error message
- Loading states â†’ Shows spinner with loading text
