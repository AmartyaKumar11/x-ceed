# Prep Plans Section - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Prep Plans section** as requested! Instead of the original approach of saving jobs first and then creating prep plans, we now have a dedicated **"Prep Plans"** section in the sidebar that shows all created prep plans as cards, accessible from anywhere in the application.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Sidebar Integration**
- Added **"Prep Plans"** menu item to applicant sidebar
- Uses graduation cap icon for visual clarity
- Direct navigation to `/dashboard/applicant/prep-plans`

### 2. **Dedicated Prep Plans Page**
- **Card-based layout** showing all user's prep plans
- **Progress tracking** for each plan (0-100%)
- **Status badges** (active, in-progress, completed)
- **Job details** (company, location, salary, type)
- **Creation date** display
- **Delete functionality** with confirmation dialog
- **Continue/Start learning** buttons
- **Empty state** with helpful call-to-action buttons

### 3. **Prep Plans API** (`/api/prep-plans`)
- **GET** - Fetch user's prep plans with job details
- **POST** - Create new prep plan records
- **PUT** - Update progress and status
- **DELETE** - Remove prep plans
- **Database integration** with MongoDB `prepPlans` collection
- **User isolation** - users only see their own plans

### 4. **Resume Match Integration**
- **"Create Learning Plan for This Job"** button in AI Career Assistant
- **Automatic prep plan record creation** in database
- **Seamless navigation** to prep plan page with job context
- **Source tracking** (`resume-match`)

### 5. **Saved Jobs Integration**
- **"Create Prep Plan"** button on each saved job card
- **Dynamic button state** - changes to "View Prep Plan" when plan exists
- **API-based prep plan detection** (no more localStorage)
- **Automatic prep plan record creation** in database
- **Source tracking** (`saved-jobs`)

## üîÑ User Workflow

```
1. User browses Jobs ‚Üí Saves interesting jobs
2. User analyzes resume in Resume Match
3. User creates prep plan from EITHER location:

4. Prep plan record created in database
5. User redirected to actual prep plan page (with Gemini API)
6. Prep plan appears in dedicated "Prep Plans" section
7. User can access all prep plans anytime from sidebar
8. User can track progress, delete plans, continue learning
```
