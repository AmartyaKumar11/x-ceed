# ✅ INTERVIEW SCHEDULING NOTIFICATION ISSUE - FIXED

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
The issue was that interview scheduling notifications were not appearing in the applicant's notification bell due to a **data type mismatch** between how notifications were stored and queried.

## 🛠️ **Root Cause**
- **Schedule Interview API** was storing `userId` as **string** (`applicant._id.toString()`)
- **Notification APIs** were querying with `userId` as **ObjectId** (`new ObjectId(auth.user.userId)`)
- This mismatch meant notifications were created but not found when querying

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Schedule Interview API** (`/src/pages/api/applications/schedule-interview.js`)
- ✅ Changed `userId: applicant._id.toString()` to `userId: applicant._id` (ObjectId)
- ✅ Enhanced notification with proper structure (title, company, position, priority, etc.)
- ✅ Set interview notifications as `priority: 'urgent'` and `actionRequired: true`

### 2. **Fixed Send Interview Invite API** (`/src/pages/api/applications/send-interview-invite.js`)
- ✅ Changed `userId: applicant._id.toString()` to `userId: applicant._id` (ObjectId)
- ✅ Enhanced notification structure for consistency

### 3. **Fixed Notifications List API** (`/src/pages/api/notifications/index.js`)
- ✅ Updated from `connectToDatabase()` to `clientPromise` for consistency
- ✅ Added missing `verifyToken` import
- ✅ Fixed database connection issues

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Database Verification**

✅ Total notifications: 7
✅ Unread notifications: 7
✅ Interview notifications: 3 (all urgent priority)
```

### **API Testing**
```
✅ Count API: { success: true, unreadCount: 7, totalCount: 7 }
✅ List API: 7 notifications returned as array
✅ Recent notifications include:
   - 📅 Interview Scheduled (interview_scheduled) - Priority: urgent
