## ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT WORKS

### Duration-Based AI Generation Process:

1. **User selects duration** from dropdown (2, 4, 6, or 8+ weeks)
2. **UI updates** description to show time commitment and focus
3. **Prep plan created** with duration stored in database
4. **AI generates** detailed plan using duration-specific prompts:
   - **2 weeks**: Emergency mode, 5-6 hrs/day, critical skills only
   - **4 weeks**: Balanced mode, 3-4 hrs/day, comprehensive coverage
   - **6+ weeks**: Mastery mode, 2-3 hrs/day, advanced topics included

### Dynamic Content Adaptation:

**2-Week Plans:**
```
"Day 1: Emergency Company Research + Critical Skill #1"
- 30-40 hours per week
- Maximum intensity
- Interview-critical skills only
- Portfolio MVP focus
```

**4-Week Plans:**
```  
"Day 1: Deep Company & Industry Research"
- 25-30 hours per week
- High intensity
- Balanced technical + behavioral prep
- 2-3 portfolio projects
```

**6+ Week Plans:**
```
"Day 1: Foundation & Exploration" 
- 18-20 hours per week
- Comfortable intensity
- Mastery-level understanding
- Comprehensive portfolio development
```
